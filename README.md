### Project Part 3, Objective 3: Meditation
For the creativity feature, a Meditation page was added where a user is able to relieve some of their pent up stress. When arriving on the page, the user is greeted with an option to click yes or no. Clicking no is a feature added to build up the user's stress so that they are tricked into meditating. Once the user clicks yes and continues forward with the meditation, text appears on the screen for 35 seconds, then transitions into a page with 3 different time settings. If the user didn't have enough time to read, they are able to click the back button to finish reading. Otherwise they can select one of the time options and follow the instructions to achieve nirvana.\
#### Testing Procedures
1. Navigate to the Meditation page using the Navigation bar at the top right of the page
2. Click the no button and make sure the button is moved. After the 5th button click, an alert should pop up. This should continue up until the 8th click where once the ok is clicked on the alert, the page should be redirected to the home page.
3. Go back to the page and click the yes button. Once this is clicked text should appear and dissapear after 35 seconds.
4. After the text disappears, different text should reappear along with 3 different time buttons below it and a back button in the top left corner under the header.
5. Click the back button and test to ensure that it disappears along with all of the other buttons and that you cannot click it more than once.
6. Ensure that the text reappears along with a forward button in the top right under the header. 
7. Click the forward button and after a couple seconds the time options along with the text and the back button have reappeared. 
8. Press any of the buttons and make sure that respective timer apears and is counting down.
9. Once the time is up on the timer, a text should appear stating that Time is up!
